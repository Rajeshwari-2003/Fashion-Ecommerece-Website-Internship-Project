ABSTRACT:

This project presents a responsive and user-centric Fashion E-commerce website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at offering a seamless digital shopping experience. The site features a dynamic homepage with an interactive image carousel, categorized product listings, promotional banners, and blog content to engage users and promote key offerings. Core functionalities include detailed product pages with image previews, a functional shopping cart interface, quantity selection, and coupon code input, all designed to mimic real-world retail operations. JavaScript is employed to enhance interactivity, such as enabling product image switching and automated carousel transitions, while CSS ensures a modern, responsive layout across devices. The design emphasizes visual appeal, ease of navigation, and performance optimization to deliver a satisfying user journey. Additional sections like “New Arrivals,” “Best Sellers,” and “Featured Products” allow efficient product promotion, while integrated forms and contact options enhance user engagement and feedback collection. The project serves as a foundational model for small Fashion businesses or individual entrepreneurs seeking to establish a professional online presence, combining aesthetic presentation with essential E-commerce functionality to drive customer interaction and conversion.
